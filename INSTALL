HOW TO INSTALL

1. Login as root to the box
    ssh amelco@lnvm4
    sudo su - 


2. Change to user amelco and update the sysadmin directory
    su - amelco
    svn update /home/amelco/betclic1-bc/sysadmin
    logout


3. Back as user root copy the sample config to /etc/
    cp /home/amelco/betclic1-bc/sysadmin/versioner/versioner.conf.sample /etc/versioner.conf


4. Edit the file to include or exclude items from the application. Dont forget to update the prefix with the name of the corresponding client
    vim /etc/versioner.conf

    prefix=betclic


5. Execute the versioner and follow the instructions.
    python /home/amelco/betclic1-bc/sysadmin/versioner/versioner

    1. Create a directory where to checkout the svn
        mkdir -p "/root/svn//betclic/"
    
    2. Checkout the ROOT node of that directory only but empty. You might have to create it before if it returns an error
        svn checkout --depth empty "https://util-svn.amelco.co.uk/repos/infra-repo/server-config/betclic" "/root/svn//betclic/"
    
    3. Use the correct svn user (see header of the versioner.conf)



6. Execute the application again and now it should work and in the background create a svn copy of everything specified in the /vet/versioner.conf file. To see what is going on, execute it with --verbose
    python /home/amelco/betclic1-bc/sysadmin/versioner/versioner --verbose    


7. Create a cronjob to execute this command as often as you find necessary
    crontab -e
    00      */12        *       *       *   /usr/bin/python /home/amelco/betclic1-bc/sysadmin/versioner/versioner
