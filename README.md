versioner
=========

monitor list of files, directories, the output of a command or the files returnd by a find command.
I found this useful to monitor and version changes to crons, to etc and other hadoc files.
The need to version the output of certain commands, came when we had to monitor all the crons from all users.

See the file versions.sample.conf for an example of what can be monitored and put under svn with this tool.
